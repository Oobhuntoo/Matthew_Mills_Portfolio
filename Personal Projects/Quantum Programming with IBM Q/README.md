# Quantum Programming with IBM Q

IBM created the first industrial-grade quantum computer that solve problems universally. In order to expediate their work, they opened up the quantum programming platform
to the open source community with a cloud based system called IBM Q. As someone with university training both in computing and particle physics, I qualified for compute time
on the IBM Q server. I set up a free IBM Q account and purchased a Udemy course in IBM Q computing, and I plan to start the course soon.
