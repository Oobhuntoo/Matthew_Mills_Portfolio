# Sacred Geometry

This project is still in its early stages, and will focus on creating a program to automatically graph various patterns selected to imitate a "tree of life"
type of pattern using python math and graphics libraries. One goal is to create a function that takes as its input n, and then outputs an image depicting
n-many circles intersecting eachother at even intervals around the unit circle. The origin of each circle will be 2pi/n radians away from the origin of the next circle.
Some graphical examples were creating using an graphing tool. For instance, this function would take as its input the integer 5, and then output the image shown in the file
called "Quintity.PNG". Below is a link talking about some of the geometric significance of this area of study, which has been dubbed "sacred geomtry" by ancient cultures:
