# Large Integer Multiplication

The goal of this project is to create a C++ implementation of the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm to multiply two large integers which belong to the Gigabit scale.
Once I have a rough prototype, I am going to reach out to Eric Whiting from the Idaho National Lab for permission to sponsor a student research account on INL's
high performance computers to run the computation. Below is a link to information about the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm.
