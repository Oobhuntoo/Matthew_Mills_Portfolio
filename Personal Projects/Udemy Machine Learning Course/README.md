# Machine Learning Course from Udemy
This is the working directory that I used while working through a Udemy course on Machine Learning. In the folders, any source code file that begins with "my_" was a file that I wrote during the tutorials and exercises. Any source code file that doesn't begin with "my_" is a general template that came with the course.
