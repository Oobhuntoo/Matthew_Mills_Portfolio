# Discover Permutations

This project was done for a directed study research seminar under Dr. Alexander Woo at the University of Idaho in Spring 2019.
The goal of the project was to create a python process that would take as its input a permutation and then output whether or not the
given permutation was shallow, and also to graph the permutation using matplotlib. The formal definitions of permutations and shallowness
are given in the paper "permutations.pdf" in this folder. I collaborated with Noah Jones - another student in the research class - to complete
this project. I individually wrote the functions called "permute" and "find_cycles" which implemented a recursive approach to computing all 
algebraic cycles of a the given permutation, and we collaborated on the remainder of the code.
