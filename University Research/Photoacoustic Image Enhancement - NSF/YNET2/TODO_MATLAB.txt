for each ground truth image
- divide it into 4 equal subimages
- for each subimage
    - resize to 128x128
    - randomly choose to rotate it by 90, 180, or 270
    - binary OR rotated subimage to original subimage (TODO check that images are binary)
    - plug results into sensor data kwave procedure ensuring that sensors are only on one edge
    - plug those results into time reversal
- now, we have x data (time reversal), y data (ground truth superimposed subimages)
